        <Para1>Our fine motor skill programme is designed to teach you how to help your child to improve their fine motor skills.<br />
          <br />
          The programme is broken into six different sections. There are four levels that support fine motor skill development.  Then, there are two additional sections designed to specifically help with pencil grasp and scissor skills. Each section of the programme is Â£24 to purchase.  This provides you with 6 months access to the content.  </Para1>
